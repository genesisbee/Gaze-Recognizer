# Gaze-Recognizer
Gaze Recognition - Computer Vision Class Project

# Project Scope:

* We want to be able to track and record how long the user is looking at our virtual agent from experiment footage

Why are we looking for Gaze?

During an interaction, long durations of gaze can be a good indicator of having higher rapport between a user and a virtual agent.

# Problem: 
* We annotate these videos by hand
* Human error : Fatigue, and Inconsistency 
* Invested time: A video may take an individual 15- 20 minutes per video

# Implementation :
* Import footage
* Track and record gaze using Correlation Based - Tracking as foundation
* Detected agent face
* Draw rectangle on detected face 
* Determine center of an image’s threshold
* Determine user’s distance from image’s center point
